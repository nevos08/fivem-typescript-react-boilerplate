# FiveM TypeScript React Boilerplate

This boilerplate should give you an easy start developing your FiveM scripts with TypeScript & React.

## Usage

Make sure to install all the dependencies inside the root and the "web" folder. The project is built with pnpm, so I recommend using this as well. If you want to use another package manager you need to make some changes. I will give no support for this.

## Shared

Inside the "game" folder you will find a "shared" folder. You can import everything that is in there to your React Application as well.
